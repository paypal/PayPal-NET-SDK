# PayPal SDK 2.0.0-beta [![Integration Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paypal/PayPal-NET-SDK.svg?branch=2.0-travis)](https://travis-ci.org/paypal/PayPal-NET-SDK)

This is a preview of the next major version of the PayPal .NET SDK. We've simplified the interface to only provide HTTPRequest that can easily be called via our HttpClient. This SDK is fully .NET Core 2.0 compatible. 

## What's New

Please see the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the latest changes.

### Creating a Payment

```cs
using System.Linq;
using PayPal.Core;
using PayPal.Payment;

var environment = new SandboxEnvironment("AdV4d6nLHabWLyemrw4BKdO9LjcnioNIOgoz7vD611ObbDUL0kJQfzrdhXEBwnH8QmV-7XZjvjRWn0kg", "EPKoPC_haZMTq5uM9WXuzoxUVdgzVqHyD5avCyVC1NCIUJeVaNNUZMnzduYIqrdw-carG9LBAizFGMyK");
var client = new PayPalHttpClient(environment);

var payment = new Payment()
            {
                Intent = intent,
                Transactions = new List<Transaction>() 
                {
                    new Transaction()
                    {
                        Amount = new Amount()
                        {
                            Total = "10",
                            Currency = "USD"
                        }
                    }
                },
                RedirectUrls = new RedirectUrls() 
                {
                    CancelUrl = "https://example.com/cancel",
                    ReturnUrl = "https://example.com/return"
                },
                Payer = new Payer() 
                {
                    PaymentMethod = "paypal"
                }
            };

PaymentCreateRequest request = new PaymentCreateRequest();
request.RequestBody(payment);

try 
{
  HttpResponse response = await client.Execute(request);
  var statusCode = response.StatusCode;
  Payment result = response.Result<Payment>();
} 
catch(HttpException httpException) 
{
  var statusCode = httpException.StatusCode;
  var debugId = httpException.Headers.GetValues("PayPal-Debug-Id").FirstOrDefault();
}
```
